We need to create a menu for our users. Display a menu containing three choices AND a choice to allow them to exit. Display that menu and prompt for a choice. Upon choosing the value, it should simply clear the screen and redisplay the menu (loop until the exit choice is given).
HOWEVER, we need to be sure that the end user cannot use CTL-C, CTL-Z or a KILL command to terminate the application. Add a 'trap' in the script to capture those attempts and provide instructions on how to exit the script using the menu choice instead.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
echo "vadapav , paav bhaji , sev puri"
echo "Which one would u choose from the above three menu?? \c"
read menu
trap 'echo "Enter exit to come out of loop"' 2 9 15
case $menu in
"vadapav")
	clear
	sh ./a19.sh;;
"paav bhaji")
	clear
	sh ./a19.sh;;
"sev puri")
	clear
	sh ./a19.sh;;
"exit")
	exit 0;;
*)
	clear
	sh ./a19.sh;;

esac

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a19.sh
vadapav , paav bhaji , sev puri
Which one would u choose from the above three menu?? vadapav
