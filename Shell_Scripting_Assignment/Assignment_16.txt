Create a simple text file containing a list of super heros (or some names if preferred), use at least four values, one per line in the file.

Write a bash shell script that then reads that file and displays it line by line on the terminal window.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash

echo "enter filename: \c"
read list
cat $list

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a16.sh
enter filename: list.txt
batman
superman
spiderman
ant man
aquaman
