Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run. Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
# script to create, set and display two variables to the terminal.

variable_1=$1      # $1 takes the 1st parameter from the prompt and stores that in variable 1
echo "variable_1 = $variable_1"   # then displaying the stored variable 1 
variable_2=$2      # $2 takes the 2nd parameter from the prompt and stores that in variable 2
echo "variable_2 = $variable_2"   # then displaying teh stored variable 2

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a3.sh 20 30
variable_1 = 20
variable_2 = 30
