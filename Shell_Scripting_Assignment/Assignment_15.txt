Create a script that prompts the user for a number. That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter number : \c"
read n
count=1
while [ $count -le $n ]
do
	echo "This is line number $count"
	count=$(( count+1 ))
done

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a15.sh
Enter number : 5
This is line number 1
This is line number 2
This is line number 3
This is line number 4
This is line number 5
