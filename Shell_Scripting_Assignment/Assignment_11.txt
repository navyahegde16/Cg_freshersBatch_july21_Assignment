Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash

echo "Guess the secret number between 1 and 5: \c"
read number

if [ $number -eq 1 ]
then
	echo "Yeah! you guessed it right!"
fi

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a11.sh
Guess the secret number between 1 and 5: 1
Yeah! you guessed it right!
