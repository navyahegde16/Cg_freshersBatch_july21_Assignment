Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name. Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable. Using the appropriate method to make that command line parameter visible to a function, pass the age captured to the function and display a message to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age, add a calculation of their age in number of days.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter age : \c"
read AGE
age=$AGE

hello() {
	firstname=$1
	year=365
	echo "Hello $firstname , please confirm your age i.e. $age"
	days=$((age * year))
	echo "Your age in number of days is $days"
}

hello Navya

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a23.sh 
Enter age : 21
Hello Navya , please confirm your age i.e. 21
Your age in number of days is 7665
