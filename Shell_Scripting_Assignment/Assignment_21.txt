Create a simple script containing a single function. This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run. Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash

hello(){
	echo "Hello this msg is inside the function"
}

hello
echo "Hello this msg is outside the function"

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a21.sh
Hello this msg is inside the function
Hello this msg is outside the function
