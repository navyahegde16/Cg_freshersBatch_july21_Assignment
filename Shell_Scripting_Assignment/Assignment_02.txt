Write a script that sets FOUR variables:
MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT
Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
MYUSERNAME=navya
echo MYUSERNAME = $MYUSERNAME

MYPASSWORD="abc123"
echo MYPASSWORD = $MYPASSWORD

echo "Enter Start Of Script date: \c"
read SOS
echo "START OF SCRIPT = $SOS"

echo "Enter End of Script date: \c"
read EOS
echo "END OF SCRIPT = $EOS"

OUTPUT:
MYUSERNAME = navya
MYPASSWORD = abc123
Enter Start Of Script date: 06/08/2021                        
START OF SCRIPT = 06/08/2021
Enter End of Script date: 07/08/2021
END OF SCRIPT = 07/08/2021
