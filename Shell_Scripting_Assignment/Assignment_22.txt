Create a script to demonstrate the visibility of variables and when they are available within a script and its functions. Define a global variable, a function that defines a local variable and then display both BEFORE calling the function, call the function, then display both AFTER calling the function.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash

print() {
	name="local"
	echo "This is $name variable : in the function"
}

name="global"
echo "This is $name variable : Before"
print
echo "This is $name variable : After"

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a22.sh
This is global variable : Before
This is local variable : in the function
This is local variable : After
