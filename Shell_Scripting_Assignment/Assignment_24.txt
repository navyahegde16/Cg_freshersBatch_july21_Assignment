We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:
a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.

SCRIPT:
#!/bin/bash

echo "please mention your gender male or female"
read gender

main(){
	arms=2
	legs=2
	echo "Human beings have $arms arms and $legs legs"
	$gender;
}
male(){
	nob=1
	echo "male has $nob beard"
}
female(){
	nob=0
	echo "female has $nob beard"
}
main

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a24.sh
please mention your gender male or female
female
Human beings have 2 arms and 2 legs
female has 0 beard
navya@navya:~/ss_as
