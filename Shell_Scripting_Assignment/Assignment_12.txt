Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter number between 1 to 3: \c"
read number
if [ $number -eq 1 -o $number -eq 2 -o $number -eq 3 ]
then
	echo "You entered number $number"
else 
	echo "You failed to follow instructions"
fi

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a12.sh
Enter number between 1 to 3: 1
You entered number 1
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a12.sh
Enter number between 1 to 3: 2
You entered number 2
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a12.sh
Enter number between 1 to 3: 3
You entered number 3
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a12.sh
Enter number between 1 to 3: 4
You failed to follow instructions
