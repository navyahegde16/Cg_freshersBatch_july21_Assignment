Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):
FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE
Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.

SCRIPT:
#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter FIRSTNAME: \c"
read FIRSTNAME
echo "Enter LASTNAME: \c"
read LASTNAME
echo "Enter USERAGE: \c"
read USERAGE

echo "My name $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME and my age is $USERAGE"

age_after=$(( $USERAGE + 10 ))
echo "Age in 10 years will be $age_after"

OUTPUT:
navya@navya:~/ss_assignment$ sh a8.sh
Enter FIRSTNAME: Navya
Enter LASTNAME: Hegde
Enter USERAGE: 21
My name Navya Hegde and my age is 21
Age in 10 years will be 31
